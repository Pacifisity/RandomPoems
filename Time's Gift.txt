Time is a gift that's often wasted,
Moments lost, opportunities untasted,
But in each second, a chance awaits,
To change our lives, to alter our fates.

Life's a journey, with time as our guide,
Teaching us, with patience and pride,
Every moment, every hour,
A chance to tap into time's power.

Each tick of the clock, a reminder profound,
That time moves forward, never to be bound,
We must use it with purpose and intent,
Making the most of every moment spent.

For time is precious, a treasure to hold,
A chance to make memories, to be bold,
We must seize it, before it slips away,
Embracing each moment, come what may.

Let us embrace the flow of time,
In every laugh, in every rhyme,
For time's a gift, a blessing to see,
A chance to live fully, wild and free.

Time is a gift, a precious resource,
An opportunity to chart a new course,
Let us use it to chase our dreams,
And make the most of life's endless streams.

Let us make our mark, leave a legacy,
Of kindness, of love, of empathy,
For time is short, and time is dear,
Let us make each moment count, crystal clear.
