Why long for heaven's golden gates,
When life's an 11 out of 10 by all rates,
With loving family and friends so dear,
There's much to cherish right here.

Maybe it's the fear of the unknown,
or the thought of being all alone,
that drives us to seek a higher power,
to guide us through life's darkest hour.

What we seek is already here,
Love, laughter, beauty, without a single tear,
In every moment, every day,
Let's embrace life in every way.

Let's savor the blessings life imparts,
Cherish the love in our beating hearts,
For when we've breathed our final breath,
Love's memories will triumph over death.
