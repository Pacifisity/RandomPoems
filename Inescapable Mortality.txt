Facing death, a feeling of despair,
A sense of helplessness beyond repair,
No escape, no way out,
Only darkness and uncertainty without a doubt.

The pain and suffering that it brings,
Can leave us feeling like we've lost everything,
A heavy burden we cannot shake,
As we watch life slowly slip away.

We may fight and try to resist,
But death's embrace, we cannot dismiss,
It comes for us all, without a sound,
And in its grasp, we are finally bound,

It's hard to accept, and even harder to bear,
The helplessness we feel in death's lair,
We wish we could turn back time,
And undo the damage, with a different rhyme.

But death is an end, a final goodbye,
A moment of truth, we cannot deny,
A passage to a world beyond our sight,
Where our souls will soar, in eternal flight.

So let us mourn and grieve,
The pain we feel, we cannot relieve.
We'll never overcome this strife,
For death reigns over our life.
